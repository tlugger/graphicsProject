Computer Graphics Final Project

This Project creates a scene in three different modes that allows navigation in
first person view around a natural scene created with fractal shapes.

The three unique modes for this scene are:
Day Mode: Navigating through the scene with full light and a moving sun.
Night Mode: Navigating through the scene with minimal ambient light and a flashlight shining directly in front of the view
Stormy Mode: Navigating through the scene with low ambient light with flashes coming from a fractal created lighting bolt.
